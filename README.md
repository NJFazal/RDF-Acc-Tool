# RDF-Acc-Tool

This is an adapted and updated version of an opensource plugin made by mickidum (https://github.com/mickidum/acc_toolbar)
I got rid of supurfluous features that I did not need.
I have changed the readable font to a dyslexia friendly "Lexend" font.
Obviously, the colors have been changed to look a little more my style.
I will be doing more updates to this, so stay tuned!
